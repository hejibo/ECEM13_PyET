1:00 - 1:40pm: Incorporating Eye tracking into PsychoPy Experiments
==========================================================================

To add eyetracking into your study you'll need to set up the config file (this is hardware-dependent), run a calibration routine, and then insert some simple code into your script or Builder experiment.

*******************************
Config files
*******************************

These are yaml files. Aren't they super-simple?!

*******************************
Calibrating your eyetracker
*******************************

Something here about the interface to the calib routines

*******************************
Using from Coder
*******************************

Some MINIMAL code to get running (like the coder demo but less)

*******************************
Using from Builder
