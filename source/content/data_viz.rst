1:40 - 2:40pm Eye Data Visualization
=====================================

There are seemingly endless ways to visualize and plot data collected from eye 
tracking devices. Which types of visualization are most relevant depends directly
on the application / experimental paradigm the eye tracker is being used in, 
and the type of data analysis that will be performed on the resulting data collected.

We will review example implementations for the following data visualization / plotting methods:

All the example code for data visualization is available in the python_source/data_visualization folder
of the workshop materials.
