******************************************
Scan Path Visualization of Eye Sample Data
******************************************

**Scan path overlay plots** are generally created using either:

* the eye tracker sample stream to generate the line segements for the scan path ( **Sample Based Scan Paths** )
* the fixation (and possibly saccade) event stream generated by an event parser ( **Fixation / Event Based Scan Paths** )

When a scan path overlay is sample based, areas of increased dwell time can usually be seen as the clustering of sample line segments within areas of the scene.

When an event based scan path is used, it is common for each fixation event to be plotted as a circle shape, often with each fixation circle diameter being scaled by the fixation event duration. Saccade events can be represented as lines joining the relevent surrounding fixation events, or fixations can simply be joined by lines anchored to each fixations center point, thereby not attempting to use any available saccadic information (angle, duration, etc.).

The scan path overlay code to follow uses an eye sample based approach. 

To aid in the visualization of the temportal order of the sample scan trace, a color map is used, with the color ramp normalized to the start and end time of the sample data being plotted (the trial time). This is often a more effective way of relaying temporal information on the 2D scan path plot compared to cluttering the scan path with numbers giving the trial time of eveny Nth scan path segment, or the sample index, etc. 

The basic steps involved in scan path visualization using eye data from the ioDataStore include:

A. Read eye sample (or if available eye fixation and sacade event) data from the ioDataStore.
B. Clean areas of data that are determined to have missing eye position fields.
C. Draw the screen background for the trial.
D. Draw eye position data over the screen background. (What you draw is up to you and will depend on the type of eye information being used in the plot).
E. Applying a color map to the scan path data using the time of the scan path data points as the reference into the color map.
