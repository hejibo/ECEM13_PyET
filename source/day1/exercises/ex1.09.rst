Exercise 1.9 - explore modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the `sys` module find out the:

    - the current version of Python
    - the name of the platform you're running on
    - the default encoding (ASCII or Unicode)
    - the location of the Python executable currently running

From the `os` module find the:

    - current working directory
    - the current environment variables (paths , proxies etc.) for your operating system

Work out from `numpy.random` how to generate:

    - a set of random numbers with shape = [2,3] (NB ``rand()`` won't work for this)
    - a random *integer* between 5 and 10
