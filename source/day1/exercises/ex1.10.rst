Exercise 1.10 - create an abs() function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's create a function that returns the absolute value of a numeric (a float or int). Actually Python includes one called ``abs()``, but we'll make our own called ``absol()`` for sake of the exercise.

1.10 a)
=========

Use an `if` statement that will reverse the sign of a variable `x` if `x` is negative (that's all an abs() function does).

1.10 b)
=========

Insert your if statement into a function called ``absol`` so that it returns the correct value.

1.10 c)
=========

Test the output of your new function against the built-in ``abs()`` for 100 random numbers between -1 and 1. Count the number of fails and report with a ``print`` statement at the end whether the method works.
