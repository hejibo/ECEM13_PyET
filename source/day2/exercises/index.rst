Build an experiment (Inhibition of Return)
=========================================================

In this set of exercises you will gradually build up an experiment from scratch to measure the Inhibition of Return (IOR) effect. This will give you all the basics of using PsychoPy to present your stimuli, collect responses and store data for analysis.

Inhibition of Return
-------------------------

IOR is a paradigm where a cue precedes the presentation of a target stimulus which you are required to make a judgement about. For example, a dot appears on the right of the screen then a short while later a stimulus appears in the same position and you have to judge if the stimulus is red or green. Varying the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the cue (the dot) and the stimulus affects participants reaction times.

If the SOA is less that 250ms the presence of a cue will be facilitatory - performance will be better than if the cue had not been present. If the SOA is longer that 250ms performance will actually be worse than if no cue had been present.

In order to conduct this experiment we need two conditions (with and without cue) with varying SOAs. We will now build up a script to do that.
