Py4ET: Python for Eyetracking 2013
****************************************** 

Welcome to the Python for Eyetracking Workshop. We haven't given a workshop quite like this before and some of the technologies we'll be showing you are very much at the cutting edge of what has been developed. So bear with us!

Who are we?
================

 * **Jon Peirce** created PsychoPy. He's never used an eye-tracker!
 * **Sol Simpson** was Director of Operations for SR Research Ltd, and has been contributing to PsychoPy for about a year. He's never used PsychoPy's Experiment Builder!
 * **Michael MacAskill** is a long-standing user/contributor to PsychoPy and eye-tracking studies. He's never used Sol's ioHub!
